# üèçÔ∏è India Bike Sales Analysis & Interactive Excel Dashboard
A 100% Microsoft Excel-based solution for transforming raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.


## Project Overview üìä
The core objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between various bike specifications (Brand, Model, Engine Capacity, Fuel Type, etc.) and market factors (City Tier, Daily Distance) to understand and predict the Resale Price (INR). The dataset contains 10,000 records with details on both the initial price and the final resale value, allowing for an assessment of depreciation and market value retention.


## Key Insights üí°
The analysis reveals several critical drivers of the used bike market:

Resale Price Stability: The Average Resale Price is highly stable across all four City Tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Metro), clustering tightly around INR 133,500 to INR 134,700. This indicates that the bike's intrinsic qualities (like brand and condition) are more critical for valuation than the specific city type where it's sold.

Market Share is Highly Diversified: The market is not dominated by a single player. The top five brands‚ÄîKawasaki, Yamaha, KTM, Royal Enfield, and Hero‚Äîeach hold an approximately 12% to 13% share of the total records, suggesting a highly competitive and fragmented market.

Fuel Type Parity: The market shows a near-equal distribution of bikes across Hybrid (33.6%), Petrol (33.57%), and Electric (32.83%) fuel types. This is a unique insight, suggesting that the used bike market has already fully embraced modern, diverse powertrains, with no single fuel type holding a dominant position.

Resale Value Leaders: While brands have similar initial prices, Bajaj and Yamaha show a slightly higher average resale price (INR 136,662 and INR 135,535, respectively) compared to the overall average, indicating better value retention.


## Conclusion ‚úÖ
The Indian used bike market is characterized by strong value retention across all geographic tiers and an equalized demand for diverse fuel technologies (Petrol, Hybrid, and Electric). The lack of brand dominance means that dealers and sellers must rely on precise, data-driven pricing based on model-specific features and condition (Avg Daily Distance, Owner Type) rather than relying on location or brand name alone. The findings suggest a mature, sophisticated market where buyers prioritize modern, feature-rich bikes, regardless of the city size.
